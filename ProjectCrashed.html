							In the second semester of my second year, we were put in groups of up to 6 people. My group consisted of 4 people, 2 programmers and 2 artists.
						    The courses focus was to get a hands-on experience in creating a vertical-slice of a game with a team.
							The theam for the games made that year was "Couch Co-Op". </br>
							Each member had a work a minimum of 10h per week, the project duration was 14 weeks.</br>
							Every week we had a meeting with our teachers to discuss the direction the game was taking, and how the game was progressing in it's development. 
						</p>
						<b style="margin: 0em 2em 1em 2em; text-align: justify; font-weight: 600; font-size: 120%; color: black">
							My role in the team
						</b>
						<p style="margin: 0em 2em 1em 2em; text-align: justify; color: black">
							After we had settled on an idea, and had it approved by the teachers we could start development. The first two weeks of the 
							project was spent prototyping, where my role was to prototype:
							<b style=" text-align: justify; color: black; font-weight: 400;" >
								Enemy Spawning, movement, attacks and death.
								Camera movement and tracking.
								Player controls, death/respawning and weapon use.
							</b>
							I was also involved in writing the Tech Document and setting up Perforce for the team.
							</p>
							<p style="margin: 0em 2em 1em 2em; text-align: justify; color: black">
								After we had made a prototype we were satisfied with, we moved on to production.

								The 2nd sprint started and I was tasked with finalizing the camera behavior,
								implementing the enemy behavior and the playable characters mechanics.
							</br> During the 3nd sprint, I continued on the playable characters, adding a inventory system both visually and in code, making sure the equiped weapon showed up and behaved correctly.
								this consisted of being in constant communication with the artists, giving feedback when a model had to be split up into multiple parts or resized to keep it to scale.
							</p>						
							
							<p style="margin: 0em 2em 1em 2em; text-align: justify; color: black">
								The final sprint was dessignated to polishing the game, 
								most my time was spent on finalizing the weapons behavior, 
								communicating with the artists to get the sound and particle effets added into the game.
								Final polish on the enmies, and general gameplay adjustments we noticed as we tested the game.
