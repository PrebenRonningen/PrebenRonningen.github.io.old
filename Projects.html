							For this Project I set myself a clear goal. I want to learn more about what goes into making a game egnine, and I want to be able to make a game in it. 
							The game I decided on is "X-COM: UFO Defense" from 1993. For this purpose I will focus on making what's needed to create each distinct part of the game,
							starting with the "Geoscape" the planetary overview, them the "Basescape" the Base overview, then the "Battlescape" the combat overview.

							In the second semester of my second year, we were put in groups of up to 6 people. My group consisted of 4 people, 2 programmers and 2 artists.
						    The focus of the course was to get a hands-on experience in creating a vertical-slice of a game with a team.
							The theme for the games made that year was "Couch Co-Op". </br>
							Each member worked a minimum of 10h per week in the span of 14 weeks.</br>
							Every week we had a meeting with our teachers to discuss the direction the game was taking, and how the game was progressing in it's development.

							In this project we were given a stripped down game engine at the start of the semester.
							Through the semester we had to build it back up by implementing the missing parts and create a game with it at the end.
							The final project for the course was to make a game in the engine we had spent the semester putting together.
							I decided on making a Local Co-op game, and for that I thought Bomber-Man would be a good fit.

							After having made a software rasterizer, the next step was to make a hardware rasterizer using DirectX11.
							Using the Effects framework, my final project for Graphics Programming 1 was to make a merged renderer that can 
							easily switch between the right-handed software rasterizer and the left-handed hardware rasterizer.
							The goal was to have a seamless transition at runtime between the two different rasterizers, attempting to make them look as similar as possible.

							This is the first software ray tracer I wrote in C++. I implemented a dynamic scene system
							to easily set up scenes and switch between them. The ray tracer can handle simple shapes such
							as spheres and planes, it can also render triangle meshes such as the 'Stanford Bunny'.
							Point lights and directional light have been implemented.
							To look around the scene I added multiple controlls, so the camera can easily be controlled with just the keyboard, 
							or if prefered, both keyboard and mouse. For materials I have added several BRDFs such as 
							Phong, Lambert and Cook-Torrance. Some additional functionality I added is the ability to toggle
							shadows on/off, cycle cullmode, cycle rendering mode, and toggle some lights on/off (directional lights).

							From the 28th of September 2021 I have this as my graduation research project.
							With this I would like to investigate the different pros and cons with multiple sphere generation algorithms
							like the UV Sphere, Quad Sphere, IcoSphere and the Fibonacci Sphere. I hope to compare the difference in
							vertex distribution & density, the difference in stored data, how much controll we have when subdividing,
							which lends itself best to utilize the UV space most efficiantly and which has the best triangular uniformity.
							For this there will be made a interractive sphere generation software where we will be able to apply textures, noice-maps 
							and adjust other parameters to generate a planet like object. The target bodys to replicate will be both the Moon and the Earth.
